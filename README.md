# Arrays

In C++, an array is a data structure that is used to store multiple values of similar data types in a contiguous memory location.

## About

Indexing of an array starts from 0. It means the first element is stored at the 0th index, the second at 1st, and so on.
Elements of an array can be accessed using their indices.Once an array is declared its size remains constant throughout the program.
An array can have multiple dimensions.
The number of elements in an array can be determined using the sizeof operator.
We can find the size of the type of elements stored in an array by subtracting adjacent addresses.
In C++, we can declare an array by simply specifying the data type first and then the name of an array with its size.
Data_type array_name[Size_of_array];
